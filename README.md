dot.py replaces the original dot.py from the psychopy.visual folder
this is a modified version of the original function , but now the dots are updated in the border of the apratus and not randomly on the screen.
Just a note, this code is tailerod for a square and a circle.
            


The dorGenerate.py is the main code of the experiment where you can change the size,coherence, speed, number of dots and direction separately for both the dots in the squre and the dots ion the circle.
